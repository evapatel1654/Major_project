The main idea behind this project is to determine the weather conditions of any location that is searched. I've added some features in this project, which include features like "Getting weather details of your current location just by a mouse click" and also a feature called "Get more details", which will show the weather condition of the searched place for the next few days and also provide the current weather condition in much more detail.
I've used the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather details for this project.
Also, you will notice that the background image will change according to the place you search for;for that, I've used Unsplash.
Screenshots:
This is the first view, or you can say the default view, when you first open the "Weather Forecast App," but the background image may differ as it shows a different image every time you open the app

Here I've searched 'Delhi' to know its weather condition

After I clicked the location button, it fetched my location and showed the weather condition of my place. You will notice the background image has also changed.

Now after I clicked the 'Get more details' button, it opened a different page and fetched my current location and showed the weather details of my place. And this page is currently in Light view

This page now has a placeholder where it will fetch weather information for any country in this globe.
